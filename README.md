# Padrino Example for Large Applications

This example is intended for Padrino users who already have some basic
experience but want an example with more focus on common configuration tasks
required by larger projects:

  - Divide the application into [multiple gems](https://github.com/zenbits/pademo/tree/master/vendors)
  - [Asset pipeline](https://github.com/zenbits/pademo/wiki/Asset-Pipeline) 
  - [User authentication](https://github.com/zenbits/pademo/wiki/Authentication)
  - [Testing](https://github.com/zenbits/pademo/wiki/Testing)

The goal is to provide as much configuration code within the least amount of
functionality clutter. Therefore the application is just a couple of hello
world pages with a logging feature. 

If you start a new project and are trying to figure out how some configuration
was done without production code, you might find it here. If you have common
configuration code you reuse, or a more interesting folder layout, do not
hesitate to open an issue for discussion.

## TODO

There is still room for improvement, cleaning to do, and the testing part is
quite poor.  I might improve things depending on the feedback, but my original
intention was providing the example I wanted to have when I started
with Padrino.
